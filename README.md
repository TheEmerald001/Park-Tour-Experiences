## Project Idea
Domestic tourism has been on the low in kenya, despite the more than enough attraction sites. With nature in mind, such unique sight offered have to be maintained to prevent extinction of rare species, all while preserving and conserving the attractions for the generations to come.

In a bid to bolster local tourism while promoting interactivity in the wild, I aim to develop a simple application that intergrates previewing, contribution to the data and real time viewing and donations to help the cause.

The application will thus consume custom APIs from the KWS, KFS, and user drives to display rare bird, snake, butterfly and tree species in common trails in the Tropical Kakamega Rain Forest.

In such manner, tourists are able to anticipate the views along selected trails, keep in touch with its progression by marking out seen species, all while allowing for a philanthropical intention on the go by making donation for their best species. 

A runnig application that caters for all this is highlighted below.

## Understanding The Interface
 
The web page will provides a simple description of the attraction site, and asks the user to enter their name and preferred startin trail. This is used to load the API that contains data for the given trail, and display it to them. The view also allows for donations. Viewed species are hidden and a record kept. At the end of the trail, a new trail is selected and so on. On completion, a summation is provided for the veiwed species and donated amount.

As an addition, a user is able to post a new sighting, which shall be persisted to incumbent users.

## Technologies Used
* The application is majorly centered on providing a robust and rapid viewing and interaction experience, and is thus built with react-js.
* Backend data storage and authentication is done using a lheroku, which is set up to receive post, offer requiests and all that mimicks a server environment.
* Under the good, is JavaScript code and logic to implement various functionalities.

* A few gimmicks, ofcourse, and more to come!
